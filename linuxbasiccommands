1. type command is used to identy whether command is internal or external

ex-    
> type uname 
output -> uname is /usr/bin/uname

> type echo
output -> echo is a shell builtin

2.Display environment variable

> env

3. How to change the PS1 for variable controlling

> PS1 ="My new project: "
it will replace the $ with "My new project"
My new project: echo hello world
output
My new project: hello world

4. how you know whether process is in subshell or not
> echo $SHLVL
>1

A 1 indcate you are not in subshell because subshell have higher numbers.

5. To preserve an environment variable you need to employ the "export" command

> export variable_name

6. You can reverse any modification you make to the variable by using the Unset command

> unset PS1

7. Getting help for any command
> man uname

8. To view the history of recent commands
> history

To display the comnmand on the history
> !310 -> 310 is the number which define the command executed 

Note - History command is used in bash shell.

To execute the most recent command
> !!
9. Three popular Text Editors in Linux
a. emacs
b. nano
c. vim stands for "vi"

Ubuntu use alternative of Vim called vim.tiny

VIM Editor Modes

Three standard modes 
    1. Command Modes - Sometimes called normal mode and is used when you enter first time

    2. Insert Mode -  Sometimes called edit or entry mode. This mode is used for simple editing.

    3. Ex Mode - Sometimes called colon command mode.

10. Display a small file use Cat command
> cat filename

Options used in cat command

-A  - Equivalent to using the option -vET combination
-E  - Display a $ when a new line linefeed s encountered
-n  - Number all text files lines and display that number in the output
-s  - Do not display repeated blank empty lines
-T  - Display a ^I when a tab character is encountered
-v  - Display non printing characters when encountered using either ^ and/or M-notation

11. Paste command is used to join the two files together side by side

> paste file1 file2

12. OD command is used to to troubleshoot if any file modified by a program. It allows you to display a file contents in Octal , hexadecimal , decimal and ASCII.

od filename
-o  - Octal
-d  - decimal
-x  - hexadecimal

13. Split command us used to divide a large file into small chunks. You can divide a file using size, bytes, lines. 
Note - The original input remains unchanged and aditional new files will create depending on the command options.
> cat file1
output
> This is a file
> input1
> input2
> input3
> input4

To split
> split -l 3 file1 split

will generate two files splitaa and spilitab
> ls split*
splitaa splitab

> cat splitaa
output
> This is a file
> input1
> input2

> cat splitab
> input3
> input4

14. Sort utility sorts a files data. It will not change the original file only the output is sorted.

> sort file1

15. "nl" command is file formatting command. This utility is used to number lines in a text file.

> nl file

16. File Viewing Commands
    1. Reading a large text file is using a pager. the two most commonly used pagers are the more and less command utility 
        More - you can move forward through a text file by pressing the spacebar(one page down) or the enter key (one line down). You can not move backward through a file.
        > more filename
        Less - the less page utility allows the faster file traversal because it does not read the entire file
                prior to displaying the file first page. Up and down key is used to traverse the file.
        > less filename

    2. head - display the top file text and it will display by default 10 lines of a text file.
        > head filename
        or
        > head -n 2 filename -> display two line from the top of the text file.
    
    3. tail - display by default 10 last lines for the text files
        > tail filename
        or
        > tail -n 5 filename -> display last 5 lines for the text files

        Note the most useful tail utility feature is its ability to watch log files.

        > sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log

        -f or --follow  - switch on the tail command 

17. File summarizing commands

    1. WC command is used to determine counts in a text file
    > wc filename -> No of lines, words and bytes in that order

    2. CUT command is used to sift through the data in a large text file
    > cut -d ":" -f 1,7 /etc/passwd

    3. uniq command is used to find the repeated linex in text file.
    > uniq filename

    4. MD% algorith- md5sum is based on MD5 message digest algorith. It is originally created for the cryptography. 
       it is still excellent for checking a file integrity.
    > md5sum filename

    it produce a 128 bit hash value. 

    5. Secure hash algorithm is used for cryptography purpose . It is also used for checking the file integrity after it is copied or moved to another location.
     a. To find SHA utility names
       > ls -l /usr/bin/sha???sum
        output
       > /usr/bin/sha224sum
       > /usr/bin/sha256sum
       > /usr/bin/sha384sum
       > /usr/bin/sha512sum

       Example
       > sha256sum filename

18. Regular expression
